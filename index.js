  3. We didn't use var because that would have made the var a gobal scope variable. Meaning that any where in the code we could aceess the varable contents and change it.*/

* 3. New Binding whenever a constructor function is used, 'this' refers to the specific instance of the object that is created.
* 4. Explicit binding Whenever the call or apply method is used, 'this' is sxplicitly defined.

  Object oriented design is commonly used in video games.  For this part of the assignment you will be implementing several constructor functions with their correct inheritance hierarchy.
  In this file you will be creating three constructor functions: GameObject, CharacterStats, Humanoid.

  Each constructor function has unique properties and methods that are defined in their block comments below:
